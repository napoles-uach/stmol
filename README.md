# Stmol
A component for building interactive molecular visualizations within Streamlit web-applications. It is designed to provide a state of the art visualizing and rendering 3D molecular structures for researchers, in a user-friendly manner.

------------------------------
## Stmol features 

- An easy-to-use component for rendering interactive 3D molecular visualizations of protein and ligand structures within Streamlit web-apps
- `stmol` can render protein and ligand structures with just a few lines of Python code by utilizing popular visualization libraries, currently Py3DMol and Speck. 
- On the user-end, `stmol` does not require expertise to interactively navigate. 
- On the developer-end, `stmol` can be easily integrated within structural bioinformatic and cheminformatic pipelines to provide a simple means for user-end researchers to advance biological studies and drug discovery efforts.
------------------------------

## Stmol installation

`stmol` runs with traditional Python stack.
To install `stmol` from [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/stmol/), run this command in your terminal:

``` console
pip install stmol==0.0.9
```

Since the end goal of `stmol` plugin, is to ebnable easy rendering of molecular structure within the streamlit applicaton, libraries such as 
[streamlit](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit) and [py3Dmol](https://pypi.org/project/py3Dmol/) are crucial to work with. 
Run this command in your terminal to install the latest release of Streamlit,
``` console
pip install streamlit
```
Run this command in your terminal to install the latest release of py3Dmol,
``` console
pip install py3Dmol
```
A recent addition to `stmol` project, in a form of static HTML wrapper is the `speck_plot()` function, which helps in rendering [Speck](https://github.com/wwwtyro/speck) structures within the Streamlit web-application, is dependent on the following libraries, 
```console
ipyspeck(==0.6.1)
ipywidgets(==7.6.3)
```

## Quickstart

##### 1. Protein visualization using `showmol()`function 

- **Using `py3Dmol object`**

To visualize any protein structure, all we need is the PDB ID of the protein.
```python
from stmol import showmol
import py3Dmol
# 1A2C
# Structure of thrombin inhibited by AERUGINOSIN298-A from a BLUE-GREEN ALGA
xyzview = py3Dmol.view(query='pdb:1A2C') 
xyzview.setStyle({'cartoon':{'color':'spectrum'}})
showmol(xyzview, height = 500,width=800)
```
- **Using the `render_pdb()` function**

The `render_pdb()` function accepts any PDB ID and returns a py3Dmol object. 
```python
from stmol import *
showmol(render_pdb(id = '1A2C'))
```

##### 2. Labelling protein using `render_pdb_resn()`function 
Inorder to annotate the residues, we can use the `render_pdb()` function, for example *Alanine* [ALA] residues,here,
```python
showmol(render_pdb_resn(viewer = render_pdb(id = '1A2C'),resn_lst = ['ALA',]))
```
